prompt: "Look up the gameAsset entry or entries where `$INPUT` in src/20F0.c. Look at the assets it references (an asset is anything ending in _ROM_START/_ROM_END). Look also at the assets array that it references (e.g. NANCY_ASSETS). Update all the assets to have proper names (e.g. NANCY_ANIMATION_DATA) rather than nonsense names such as _527EE0. This will require you to rename the asset in snowboardkids2.yaml and the USE_ASSET reference in include/assets.h. Commit your changes once the renaming is finished"
