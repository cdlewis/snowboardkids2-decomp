prompt: "Look up the gameAsset entry or entries where `$INPUT` in src/20F0.c. This hex address should match an actual function, look up what that function name is an change the hex value to be a pointer to that function instead. symbol_addrs.txt is a good reference for function names for a given hex address. If you see any memcopy calls that operate on a Transform3D type, ensure size is defined as sizeof(Transform3D) not 0x20. Commit your changes once the renaming is finished"
