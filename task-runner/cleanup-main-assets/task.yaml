prompt: "Look up the modelEntityConfigs entry or entries where `$INPUT` in src/main.c. This hex address should be an asset entry. Look for the appropriate entry in assets.h/snowboardkids2.yaml. If the entry is not present, you will need to add it. In both cases, ensure that it has a semantically appropriate name (based on the asset name, e.g. TOWN_DISPLAY_LIST). commit your changes when you're done."
